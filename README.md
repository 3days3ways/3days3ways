# Hi, I’m Renee 👋

**Trying to turn chaos into systems.**  
AI automations • no-code apps • Notion dashboards • scrappy MVPs  
**Shipping > perfect.**

---

## What I’m building
- ⚙️ Simple automations that save time (and reduce mental load)
- 🧩 No-code + “vibe-coded” micro tools
- 🗂️ Notion dashboards + templates that actually get used
- 🚀 Scrappy MVPs to test ideas fast

---

## What I’m learning (in public)
- AI workflows + agents (practical, not hype)
- Product thinking for digital products & micro-SaaS
- Content systems that make consistency easier

## Current vibe
If it works, it ships.  
If it’s messy, we iterate.  
If it’s chaos, we systemize.

---

## Quick note
I’m early in the journey—expect experiments, drafts, and rapid improvements.
